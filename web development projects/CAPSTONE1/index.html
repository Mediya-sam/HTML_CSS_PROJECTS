    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>My interest in marketing came as a result of my bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering, which required me to manage the supply chain, regulate budgets, and complete projects within a certain time frame. This experience led me to Seneca College, where I studied marketing. I have improved my abilities as a result of this training.
        As well as marketing lessons, having the opportunity to collaborate on team projects with people of different nationalities has taught me a valuable lesson such as how to analyse a situation from different people's perspectives and knowledge of communication. These are two of the most important abilities a marketer may have.
        It is the right moment for me to put my previous work experiences along with my understanding of marketing in the real world, which is why I am seeking for a full-time position in the area of digital marketing.</p>
